# Privacy Policy - Vocabulary 90 Add-on
This Privacy Policy describes how Kirill Fertikov ("Developer") protects your privacy when you use the Vocabulary 90 Add-on ("Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined in this policy.

## Data Collection and Use
- The Service is designed to help users work more effectively with their documents and automate certain tasks.
- The Service does not collect, store, or use any personally identifiable information outside of your Google account.
- The Service is reviewed according to Google’s guidelines for safeguarding user data before it is publicly available. For more information, see [Google’s Add-on Review Process](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/gsuite-addon-review).
- For the Service to function, it requires access to certain data (“Personal Data”) in your Google Spreadsheet, Google Drive, or other services within your Google Workspace.
- The Service only interacts with the Personal Data that you explicitly consent to and authorize.
- All interactions with Personal Data occur within and under the authority of your Google account.
- The Service does not transmit Personal Data to the Developer or any third parties.
- Any calculations or actions performed on your Personal Data are conducted solely within your account and cannot be accessed by the Developer.
- You retain all intellectual property rights over your Personal Data.
- For details on the specific permissions the Service requires, see the “Authorization Scopes” section below.

## Authorization Scopes
The permissions below are required for the Service to function and include descriptions of how each is used:

- **Send email as you**
  - Used to send you lists of vocabulary sentences. The email sender appears as your own email address.

- **See, edit, create, and delete your spreadsheets in Google Drive**
  - Used to read vocabulary sentences from a spreadsheet to generate lists that will be emailed to you.
  - Edit access is required to update spreadsheet data, such as tracking how many times each sentence was sent and the last sent date.
  - Permissions to create and delete spreadsheets are not used by the Service but are part of the Google OAuth API that accompanies the edit permission.

- **Display and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars inside Google applications**
  - Used to create a settings sidebar for configuring mailing schedules. This sidebar uses custom HTML for an improved user experience.

- **Allow this application to run when you are not present**
  - Used to schedule daily vocabulary email mailings.

- **View your email address**
  - Used to filter sent emails. Since vocabulary emails are sent from your address, this permission helps filter them based on the sender.

- **View your email messages when the add-on is running**
  - Required to read a spreadsheet ID and sheet name embedded within an email message. This data, stored in a hidden HTML tag of the email, is used for the “Mark as read” functionality.

- **Run as a Gmail add-on**
  - Enables the “Mark as read” feature, which marks the vocabulary email as read and prevents the next email from being sent if the previous one remains unread.

- **View your country, language, and timezone**
  - Used to provide localized settings for the Gmail add-on user interface.

You can review and manage permissions granted to your Google account under **Security** > **Third-party apps with account access**.
