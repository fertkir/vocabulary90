# Vocabulary 90
[По-русски](README_ru.md)

**Vocabulary 90** is an app which makes remembering new vocabulary easier.
Because it's a lot more efficient than reading word-translation tables, you will decrease your time spent studying and
increase the amount you learn.

## How the learning process looks like ([check the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGMwl8s3xDk))
The app is based on a ["90 Second Method"](https://brightside.me/inspiration-tips-and-tricks/90-second-method-that-can-help-you-memorize-foreign-words-and-not-forget-them-533110/):
1. When you come across a new word, you write it down with the sentence into the first column of a Google Sheet. The word in a sentence you mark with a bold font weight.
2. During the next 7 days the app will send you the sentence to your Gmail. Your task is to read the sentence 1-2 times. You also have to understand the meaning of the word while reading.
3. After 7 days you make a one-week timeout after which the app sends you the sentence to read it again.
4. And, finally, after two more weeks off, the app sends you the sentence for the last time.

Supposing you spend 10 seconds to read the sentence, you'll totally spend 10 * 7 + 10 + 10 = 90 seconds in order to adopt the word.

## Why would I use the app?
- You don't have to remember how many times you've read each sentence. Just add a new sentence to the end of the column, and the app will do all the other work.
- If while reading the sentence you can't recall the meaning of the word - click on it, and the word will be opened in a dictionary.
- If you learn multiple languages, then you can maintain lists of sentences on different sheets of a spreadsheet. You will receive a separate email for each sheet.
- If you are out of time today and can't read the email, or if you've read only part of the sentences, you can mark how many you have read. The app will take it into account when sending you an email next day.

## How to collect sentences for the app
Sentences can be found in most online dictionaries, but copy-pasting them to Google Sheet is tedious. Instead you can use [Vocabulary to Google Sheet browser add-on](https://github.com/fertkir/vocabulary-to-google-sheet) to save sentences to a Google Sheet in one click.
